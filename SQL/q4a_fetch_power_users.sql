-- Who are Fetchâ€™s power users?
-- Solution #1 (App Engagement): Power users scanned atleast 2x more receipts than the minimum receipts scanned by top 1 percentile of the users

-- CTE to compute number of receipts scanned per user
with cte_receipts_per_user as (
    select
        user_id, 
        count(distinct receipt_id) as n_receipts

    select percentile_cont(n_receipts, 0.99) over () as top1_n_receipts
    from cte_receipts_per_user
    limit 1
)
-- Final query to fetch the users who scanned at least twice more than the minimum receipts scanned by top 1 percentile users
